> It's clearly a crisis of two things: of consciousness and conditioning. We have the technological power, the engineering skills to save our planet, to cure disease, to feed the hungry, to end war; But we lack the intellectual vision, the ability to change our minds. We must decondition ourselves from 10,000 years of bad behavior. And, it's not easy. -Terence McKenna

I think, somehow, that AI's going to help us with this. That's the purpose of this site. I bring a somatic, relational perspective to this scintillating collective conversation, one of the most unique and important in our times, that's also psychedelically informed and aware, at this inflection point or phase shift in human beingness on this planet.

Rather than simply worry or wring our hands, I think it's important to continually envision a transformed future. Rather than simply extrapolate our existing culture and systems, I think it's important to dream big, while staying grounded. There's a continuum between fear and hope: my intention is to do my best to cultivate hope, by helping dream into being the adjacent possible.
