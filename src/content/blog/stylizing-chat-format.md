description: Testing custom block styles in Astro
draft: "true"
---
Ok, I got it working! This is the site of my new blog. Getting it up and running was a bit of a technical challenge: I'm using Astro, deployed via GitHub Pages. I can edit these files in Markdown, using Obsidian, hit Save, and then push my changes up to GitHub â€” compile takes place automatically via the static site generator, and the site is deployed. Pretty fun. That was a unique challenge, too, because I found a use for my old domain name, `pltfrm.com`. And as you can see, I'm testing markdown features, here. Let's try [a link](https://www.google.com).

I need a style for info or commentary interspersed between tagged blocks... Will this even break the compiler?
