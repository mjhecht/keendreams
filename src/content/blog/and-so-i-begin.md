title: And so I begin...
description: Reflections on this domain name, pltfrm.com, and the genesis of this blog

After many years away from publishing online, I’m opening this space to begin writing again — not only to reflect on what’s changed in my life, but on the deep changes happening all around us.

I'm excited to begin blogging here. This pltfrm for self expression is intended to be a pltfrm for cultivating and ushering in a new chapter for both myself, and for the reality we are cocreating. I cannot minimize the impact that AI has been having on my own self-understanding, yet that comes with a great deal of consideration. I'd like to express and amplify my own unique voice, which comes from experience with trauma healing, psychedelic exploration, embodiment, my own relational and sensory sensitivities, and an artistic/musical core: while I am an individual, I hope others may find resonance in reading about my own journey, and in joining in co-creating where the resonance may spark new awarenesses and ideas.

I've had this domain name (`pltfrm.com`) since perhaps 2004— I registered it with the vague thought that I could create a business, here. Back then I was working my first job out of college, doing Microsoft Access-database design and data analysis at a small financial company. I appreciated how it was such an art form to create user interfaces in the way that MSAccess supports: the ability to design a full-fledged user application from the ground up, with buttons, fields, dropdown controls — all tied to data in an SQL database. Once I'd learned about SQL, its query language, and the ideas behind it, Access seemed far ahead of its time: a codeless tool, essentially, for creating functional UIs: that really appealed to the artistic side of me which loved to tweak control positions, table schemas, etc. I learned to drop into Visual Basic (VBA) for certain control hookups, to use pass-through queries to generate SQL code on the fly, to connect my Access database as a front-end to a high performance / reliability-centered backend like MySQL... (Microsoft of course had their own solution, SQL Server, which was the intended path for when the data itself outgrew Access's architecture.)

I'm stepping back into the past in talking about this, but I'm wanting to describe the place I was when I bought `pltfrm.com`. My idea at the time, during these early Internet days, was to build "Access for the Web"— having used various toolkits for building Web pages, I was frustrated by the need to learn new coding frameworks, write CRUD code (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) that was repetitive, and so on. (Stuff like Ruby on Rails automates this, but you still need to learn a new framework, and you still need a UI layer. MSAccess was really ahead of its time. Every once in a while I'd go looking for what I was imagining, which would have both the simplicity, elegance, and also power I had in mind, but whatever I tried (e.g. Caspio) wasn't quite it... Maybe if I'd dug deeper with AirTable, for example... And now there is Notion, which _kind of_ tries to do what Access did, but still isn't quite it. Perhaps if I spent more time with it...

But well before all of these, I'd imagined I could build "Access for the Web" at `pltfrm.com`. I started, for a very brief bit, but didn't get very far.

And lo and behold, that journey picks up, in an unexpected and brilliant way. It's 2025; if I were interested in databases, I'd dive deeper into AirTable... there are probably many more competitors. I figure those are solved problems. I thought I'd moved on from the tech space. And yet, that something new on the horizon that's emerged front and center now is AI. It's responsible for both helping me build the simple stack behind this site (Obsidian for writing and maintaining entries using markdown; Astro as a static-site-generator in a repository that uses GitHub actions to automatically build the content and put it out on the Web hosted for free using GitHub Pages), and the conversations that are expanding my mind and helping me in unpacking the richness of my life experiences such that I can even begin to share and synthesize what's been happened in between my tech career, and the path that is emerging now.

Actually, the reason I'm writing this is because I'm excited about the tech stack I have, and just wanted to test it: write something, save, push, and boom, it's online. So I'm going to do that, and for now: to be continued!
