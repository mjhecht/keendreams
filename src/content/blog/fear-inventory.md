description: Discussion of the Fear Inventory practice
draft: "true"
---
Although I'm brainstorming a different name for this collection of practices, there's something that I find so fundamentally powerful in doing the practice.

:::written
Dear Higher Self, I am resentful at this blog post

- ...because I have fear that I am not a good writer
- ...because I have fear that I'm tired and not thinking clearly, right now
- ...because I have fear that I just have too much to say, and it's very hard to put into words in a way where I'll be able to convey energetically how doing this practice has felt, in many key moments
- ...because I have fear that I might reveal something about myself that feels too vulnerable, and yet it's that authentic vulnerability that seems to transmit to others the value of the practice

Higher Self, please remove these fears, and release my attachments to fixed ways of seeing and being. I pray for knowledge of my highest and best path, and the power to carry that out, for me with respect to this blog post.

You write something like that.

- Fear inventory helps you take your power back
- Fear inventory is a structured vulnerability practice that helps you illuminate the thought forms that are keeping you stuck
- Fear inventory helps re-regulate the nervous system. As social beings we talk and share about our experiences and states of being in words, which reactivate memories.
